# Security and Privacy Policy

## Motivation
BNB Portfolio Manager started as a personal project to manage my own stock portfolio without relying on subscription services or giving away my financial data. I'm sharing it because I believe others might find it useful for the same reasons.

## Data Storage and Privacy
The application is completely offline-first. Every piece of data - your portfolio information, transaction records, and market data - is stored only on your computer in a local database. When you import transaction to the application, or download market data from Yahoo Finance, it all stays on your device.

As such, the BNB Portfolio Manager:
- Doesn't collect any information
- Doesn't track usage
- Doesn't require an account, subscription or cloud storage
- Has no way to access or transmit your data anywhere, even if requested by law

## Internet Usage
The only time BNB Portfolio Manager connects to the internet is when you click to update market data, or verify stocks. When you do this, it fetches current market data from Yahoo Finance and saves it locally on your computer. During these market data updates, Yahoo Finance's API generates technical log files that help the user diagnose connection issues. These logs contain basic information about the API calls and are stored in a temporary log file in your computer's local memory and therefore, are automatically cleared once the application is closed.

## Reporting Issues

## Keeping Your Data Safe
Since all data stays on your computer, standard computer security practices apply:
- Keep your computer's security up to date
- Be careful about sharing your database or transaction files
- Do not share your computer passwords or log in details
